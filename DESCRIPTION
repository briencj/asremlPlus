Description: Assists in automating the selection of terms to include in mixed models when  
  'asreml' is used to fit the models. Also used to display, in tables and graphs, predictions   
  obtained using any model fitting function and to explore differences between predictions. 
  The content  falls into the following natural groupings: (i) Data, (ii) Object 
  manipulation functions, (iii) Model modification functions, (iv) Model testing functions, 
  (v) Model diagnostics functions, (vi) Prediction production and presentation functions, 
  (vii) Response transformation functions, and (viii) Miscellaneous functions (for further 
  details see 'asremlPlus-package' in help). A history of 
  the fitting of a sequence of models is kept in a data frame. Procedures are available for 
  choosing models that conform to the hierarchy or marginality principle and for displaying 
  predictions for significant terms in tables and graphs. The 'asreml' package provides a 
  computationally efficient algorithm for fitting mixed models using Residual Maximum 
  Likelihood. It is a commercial package that can be purchased from 
  'VSNi' <https://vsni.co.uk/> as 'asreml-R', who will supply a zip file for local 
  installation/updating (see <https://asreml.kb.vsni.co.uk/>). It is not needed for functions that are 
  methods for 'alldiffs'  and 'data.frame' objects. The package 'asremPlus' can also be 
  installed from <http://chris.brien.name/rpackages/>.
