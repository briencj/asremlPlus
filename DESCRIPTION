Description: Assists in automating the testing of terms in mixed models when 'asreml' is used 
  to fit the models. The content falls into the following natural groupings: (i) Data, (ii) Object 
  manipulation functions, (iii) Model modification functions, (iv) Model testing functions, 
  (v) Model diagnostics functions, (vi) Prediction production and presentation functions, 
  (vii) Response transformation functions, and (viii) Miscellaneous functions. A history of the 
  fitting of a sequence of models is kept in a data frame. Procedures are available for choosing 
  models that conform to the hierarchy or marginality principle and for displaying predictions 
  for significant terms in tables and graphs. The packages 'asreml' and 'asreml4' provide a 
  computationally efficient algorithm for fitting mixed models using Residual Maximum 
  Likelihood. They are commercial packages that can be purchased from 
  'VSNi' <http://www.vsni.co.uk/> as 'asreml-R', who will supply a zip file for local 
  installation/updating.
