\title{Using supplied predictions, forms all pairwise differences between a set of 
       predictions, their standard errors and p-values for the differences.}
\description{Uses predictions and standard errors of pairwise differences from an 
  \code{alldiffs} object to form, for those components not already present, 
  (i) a table of all pairwise differences of the predictions in an \code{alldiffs} 
  object, (ii) the p-values of each pairwise difference, and (iii) the minimum, mean and 
  maximum LSD values. Predictions that are aliased (or nonestimable) are removed 
  from the \code{predictions} component of the \code{alldiffs} object and 
  standard errors of differences involving them are removed from the \code{sed} component. 
  
  Also, the rows of \code{predictions} component are ordered so that they are in standard order 
  for the variables in the \code{classify}. That is, the values of the last variable change 
  with every row, those of the second-last variable only change after all the values of the last 
  variable have been traversed; in general, the values of a variable are the same for all the 
  combinations of the values to the variables to its right in the \code{classify}. In addition, 
  if necessary, the order of the columns of the variables in the \code{predictions} component are 
  changed to match their order in the \code{classify}. The \code{sortFactor} or \code{sortOrder} 
  arguments can be used to order of the values for the \code{classify} variables, which is 
  achieved using \code{\link{sort.alldiffs}}. 

  Each p-value is computed as the probability of a t-statistic as large as or larger than 
  the absolute value of the observed difference divided by its standard error. The 
  p-values are stored in the \code{p.differences} component. The degrees of freedom of 
  the t-distribution is the degrees of freedom stored in the \code{tdf} attribute of the 
  \code{alldiffs} object. This t-distibrution is also used in calculating the 
  LSD statistics stored in the \code{alldiffs} object.

                    object of class \code{asremlPredict} such as 
                    is stored in the \code{pvals} component of the \code{prediction} component 
                    of the value produced by \code{predict.asreml}. That is, in addition to 
                    variables classifying the predictions, it will include columns named 
                    \code{predicted.value}, \code{standard.error} and \code{est.status}; 
                    each row contains a single predicted value. It may also contain
                    columns for the lower and upper confidence limits for the predictions. 
                    If \code{LSD} is not \code{NULL} then the mean LSD will be added as an attribute 
                    named \code{meanLSD}, it being calculated as the square root of the mean 
                    of the variances of pairwise differences.}
 \item{classify}{a \code{character} string giving the variables that define the margins 
                    of the multiway table that has been predicted. Multiway tables are

                    classifying variables, that is, separating the variable names 
                    with the \code{:} operator.}

                    the predictions; it should have the same number of rows and columns as there are

 \item{p.differences}{a \code{matrix} containing p-values for all pairwise differences 
                    between the predictions; each p-value is computed as the probability of a t-statistic 
                    as large as or larger than the observed difference divided by its standard error. 
                    The degrees of freedom of the t distribution for computing it are computed as 
                    the denominator degrees of freedom of the F value for the fixed term, if available; 
                    otherwise, the degrees of freedom stored in the attribute \code{tdf} are used;

                    between the predictions; they are used in computing the p-values.}

                    the significance of pairwise differences, the mean LSD being calculated using

 \item{meanLSD.type}{A \code{\link{character}} string determining whether the mean LSD stored is 
             (i) the \code{overall} mean, based on the square root of the mean of the variances of 
             all pairwise variances, (ii) the mean for each \code{factor.combination} of the 
             \code{\link{factor}s} specified by \code{LSDby}, which is based on the square root of 
             the mean of the variances for all pairwise differences for each factor combination, or 
             (iii) the \code{per.prediction} mean, based, for each prediction, 
             on the square root of the mean of the variances for all pairwise differences 
             involving that prediction.}
\item{LSDby}{A \code{\link{character}} (vector) of factor names, being the names of the 
             \code{\link{factor}s} for each of whose levels combinations a mean LSD,

                    that is consistent with an object of class \code{asremlPredict} such as

                    of the value produced by \code{predict.asreml}. That is, in addition to 
                    variables classifying the predictions, it will include columns named 
                    \code{backtransformed.predictions} and \code{est.status}; it may also contain 
                    columns for the lower and upper confidence limits; 
                    each row contains a single predicted value.}
 \item{response}{a \code{character} specifying the response variable for the 
                    predictions. It is stored as an attribute to the \code{alldiffs}

 \item{term}{a character string giving the variables that define the term 
                 that was fitted using \code{asreml} and that corresponds

                 It is stored as an attribute to the \code{alldiffs} object.}
 \item{tdf}{an \code{integer} specifying the degrees of freedom of the standard error. It is used as 
                the degrees of freedom for the t-distribution on which p-values and confidence 
                intervals are based. 
                It is stored as an attribute to the \code{alldiffs} object.}
 \item{x.num}{A character string giving the name of the numeric covariate that 
              corresponds to \code{x.fac}, is potentially included in terms in the 
              fitted model and which corresponds to the x-axis variable. It should 
              have the same number of unique values as the number of levels in 
              \code{x.fac}.}
 \item{x.fac}{A character string giving the name of the factor that corresponds to 
              \code{x.num}, is potentially included in terms in the fitted model and 
              which corresponds to the x-axis variable. It should have the same 
              number of levels as the number of unique values in \code{x.num}. 
              The levels of \code{x.fac} must be in the order in which they are to 
              be plotted - if they are dates, then they should be in the form 
              yyyymmdd, which can be achieved using \code{as.Date}. However, the levels
              can be non-numeric in nature, provided that \code{x.num} is also set.}
 \item{level.length}{The maximum number of characters from the the levels of 
            factors to use in the row and column labels of the tables of 
            pairwise differences and their p-values and standard errors.}
 \item{pairwise}{A logical indicating whether all pairwise differences of the
                \code{predictions} and their standard errors and p-values are to be 
                computed and stored. If \code{FALSE}, the components \code{differences} 
                and \code{p.differences} will be \code{NULL} in the returned 
                \code{alldiffs} object.}

                       \code{alldiffs} object.}
\item{sortFactor}{A \code{character} containing the name of the 
              \code{factor} that indexes the set of predicted values that determines 
              the sorting of the \code{alldiffs} components by 
              \code{\link{sort.alldiffs}}. If \code{NULL} then sorting is not carried 
              out. If there is more than one variable 
              in the \code{classify} term then \code{sortFactor} is sorted for the 
              predicted values within each combination of the values of the sortWithin 
              variables: the \code{classify} variables, excluding the 
              \code{sortFactor}. There should be only one predicted value for 
              each unique value of \code{sortFactor} within each set defined by a 
              combination of the values of the sortWithin variables.}

              \code{numeric} that is a \code{classify} variable for the predictions, 
              excluding \code{sortFactor}. Each component should contain a single 
              value that is a value of the variable. The combination of this set 
              of values will be used to define a subset of the predicted values whose 
              order will define the order of \code{sortFactor} to be used for all 
              combinations of the \code{sortWithinVals} variables. If 
              \code{sortWithinVals} is \code{NULL} then the first value of each 
              sortWithin variable in \code{predictions} component is used 
              to define \code{sortWithinVals}. If there is only one variable in the 
              classify then \code{sortWithinVals} is ignored.}
 \item{sortOrder}{A \code{character vector} whose length is the same as the number 
               of levels for \code{sortFactor} in the \code{predictions} component of the 
              \code{alldiffs} object. It specifies the desired order of the 
              levels in the reordered components of the \code{alldiffs} object. 
              The argument \code{sortWithinVals} is ignored.

              The following creates a \code{sortOrder} vector \code{levs} for factor 
              \code{f} based on the values in \code{x}: 
              \code{levs <- levels(f)[order(x)]}.}
 \item{decreasing}{A \code{logical} passed to \code{order} that detemines whether 
              the order for sorting the \code{alldiffs} components is for 
               increasing or decreasing magnitude of the predicted values.}
 \item{\dots}{provision for passsing arguments to functions called internally - 
            not used at present.}

\value{An \code{alldiffs} object that is a list with components 
       \code{predictions} containing the predictions and 
       their standard errors, \code{vcov} containing the variance matrix of the 
       \code{predictions}, \code{differences} containing all pairwise 
       differences between the predictions, \code{p.differences} containing 
       p-values for all pairwise differences between the predictions, 
       \code{sed} containing the standard errors of all pairwise differences 
       between the predictions, and an \code{LSD} containing the mean, minimum 
       and maximum LSDs. 

       The name of the \code{response}, the \code{response.title}, 
       the \code{term}, the \code{classify}, \code{tdf}, \code{sortFactor} 
       and the \code{sortOrder} will be set as attributes to the object. 
       Note that the \code{classify} in an \code{alldiffs} object is based on the 
       variables indexing the predictions, which may differ from the 
       \code{classify} used to obtain the original predictions (for example, 
       when the \code{alldiffs} objects stores a linear transformation of predictions.
